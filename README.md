Stop emailing yourself links in 2026. Stop Slacking yourself snippets. Stop the friction.

ClipSync synchronizes your clipboard across every device on your local network. It is built for those who value flow state over file transfers. No accounts. No cloud. No latency.

### Why ClipSync

*   **Zero Configuration**: Your devices find each other instantly. No manual IP entry. No handshake. Just sync.
*   **True Privacy**: Your clipboard data never leaves your local network. It moves directly from device A to device B.
*   **Native Performance**: (5MB Ram, 0.1% CPU). It sits in the background and does its job.
